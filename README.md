# Breast Cell Classification with Fluorescence Microscopy

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of breast cells as **benign** or **malignant** using images acquired through **fluorescence microscopy** â€” one of the most advanced imaging techniques in cellular analysis. Fluorescence microscopy uses fluorescent markers to highlight specific cellular structures, allowing detailed visualization of features such as the nucleus and membrane.

These images typically contain **multiple optical channels**, each corresponding to a different fluorescent label. This enables simultaneous observation of various cellular components, which is particularly valuable in cancer research and diagnostics, as it helps detect subtle morphological and molecular differences between healthy and pathological cells.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a **mini contest** organized by the *University of Naples Federico II* for the **Machine Learning** course.  
The objective was to design and train a **deep neural network** for binary classification of breast cells, aiming to maximize the prediction **Accuracy** on a given test set.

The student achieving the best performance was required to present their methodology during the class session on **June 6th**. If the solution and explanation were evaluated positively, the author would be exempted from the final exam.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Each participant is tasked with developing one or more **prediction models** using **data analysis** and **machine learning techniques** to classify each breast cell as benign or malignant. The main evaluation metric is **Accuracy**.

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Methods

Participants are free to use external tools and platforms such as:

- KNIME
- WEKA
- MATLAB
- Python with libraries like PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is **Accuracy**.

Accuracy is defined as the percentage of correctly classified instances with respect to the total number of evaluated samples:

Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Evaluated Instances
